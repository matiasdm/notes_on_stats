# Notes on statistical analysis and inference

In these notes, I intended to summarize and clarify some concepts and statistical techniques. Multidisciplinary work poses the challenge of handling different definitions and naming conventions. The motivation for creating this document is that we will use a mixture of methods, some of them ubiquitous in machine learning, while some are standard on behavioral sciences. Different scientific communities have different standards and naming conventions. I have noticed, though, that most of the underlying ideas are similar, and very often, the same procedure is used but with a small implementation or nomenclature difference. I will try to clarify those things in this document, homogenize name conventions, and summarize the main tools and their underlying hypothesis.
